# Ganzfeld Experiment Simulator

A browser-based audiovisual stimulation tool for meditation, altered states exploration, and consciousness research. Combines binaural beats with synchronized visual flashing based on neuroscience and cosmic resonance frequencies.

## Features

### Binaural Beats
- **Stereo frequency control**: Set independent frequencies for left and right audio channels (20-20,000 Hz)
- **True binaural effect**: Different tones in each ear create perceived "beat" frequencies that influence brainwave states
- **Volume control**: Adjustable audio levels for comfortable listening

### Visual Stimulation
- **Color picker**: Choose any color for screen flashing
- **Dual flash modes**:
  - **Beat Frequency Mode**: Screen flashes at the binaural beat frequency (difference between left/right audio)
  - **Custom Frequency Mode**: Manually set flash rate (0.5-40 Hz)

### Scientific Presets

Five research-based presets combining specific frequencies and colors for different consciousness states:

#### **Schumann Resonance (7.83 Hz)**
- Earth's electromagnetic resonance
- Base: 174 Hz (Solfeggio frequency)
- Color: Indigo
- Effects: Deep meditation, grounding, connection to natural rhythms

#### **Deep Theta (4.5 Hz)**
- REM sleep and shamanic consciousness
- Base: 136.1 Hz (Om/cosmic C# frequency)
- Color: Deep violet
- Effects: Profound relaxation, lucid states, deep trance

#### **Alpha-Theta Bridge (6 Hz)**
- Creative visualization zone
- Base: 256 Hz (scientific pitch C)
- Color: Warm amber
- Effects: Meditative flow, hypnagogic imagery, creativity

#### **Lunar Resonance (1.5 Hz)**
- Moon's seismic "ringing" frequency from Apollo data
- Base: 210.42 Hz (synodic Moon frequency)
- Color: Silver
- Effects: Deep sleep induction, delta states, dream work

#### **Solar Harmonic (0.5 Hz)**
- Sun's helioseismic oscillations
- Base: 126.22 Hz (Sun's cosmic octave frequency)
- Color: Gold
- Effects: Ultra-deep meditation, profound stillness, grounding

## Safety

⚠️ **Warning**: This application contains rapidly flashing lights that can trigger photosensitive epilepsy. Do not use if you or anyone in your family has a history of seizures. Take breaks if you experience discomfort, dizziness, or disorientation.

## Usage

1. Open `ganzfeld.html` in any modern web browser
2. Accept the safety warning
3. Choose a preset or customize your own settings
4. Use headphones for proper binaural effect
5. Click Play and close/hide the menu for full-screen immersion
6. Adjust settings anytime by reopening the menu

## Technical Details

- **Self-contained**: Single HTML file, no external dependencies
- **Offline capable**: Works without internet connection
- **Cross-platform**: Compatible with all modern browsers
- **Web Audio API**: Precise frequency generation using stereo oscillators
- **Responsive design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Best Practices

- Always use **headphones or earbuds** for binaural beats to work properly
- Start with **low volume** and adjust to comfortable levels
- Use in a **quiet, dark environment** for best results
- Begin with **shorter sessions** (5-10 minutes) and gradually increase
- Keep eyes **closed or softly focused** to experience the Ganzfeld effect
- Avoid use before operating vehicles or machinery

## Scientific Background

This tool is inspired by:
- **Ganzfeld experiments**: Sensory deprivation studies in parapsychology
- **Binaural beat research**: Auditory beat stimulation for brainwave entrainment
- **Brainwave frequencies**: Delta (0.5-4 Hz), Theta (4-8 Hz), Alpha (8-13 Hz), Beta (13-30 Hz), Gamma (30+ Hz)
- **Cosmic/planetary frequencies**: Based on Hans Cousto's "Cosmic Octave" system
- **Helioseismology**: Study of the Sun's internal oscillations
- **Lunar seismology**: Apollo mission seismic data
